## What is Cloud Computing?

The cloud has become a key enabler for organisations with benefits such as high availability, unlimited capacity \
, on-demand scalability, cost savings, and flexibility. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer \
system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The \
term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant \
today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user \
is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.

## Cloud Computing Models

[A high level understanding of Cloud Computing models](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### Deployment Models

#### Public Cloud

A public cloud is a type of computing in which a service provider makes resources available to the public via the internet. Resources vary by provider but may include storage capabilities, applications or virtual machines. Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage model.

- [Public Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/public-cloud)

#### Private Cloud

A private cloud is a cloud computing model where IT services are provisioned over private IT infrastructure for the dedicated use of a single organization. A private cloud is usually managed via internal resources. Private clouds are hosted on-premise or in a dedicated space at a service provider's data center.

- [Private Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/private-cloud)

#### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments. This gives businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options.

- [Hybrid Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/hybrid-cloud)

#### Community Cloud

A community cloud is a multi-tenant cloud service model that shares computing resources among several organizations from a specific group with common computing concerns. The community cloud can be hosted internally or externally, depending on the needs of the community.

### Service Models

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. It IaaS, the provider supplies the infrastructure components that would otherwise be housed in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer and provides mechanisms to manage these resources.
It’s one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless. With IaaS, quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a service (SaaS) provides software that are run and managed by the service provider. It allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider’s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.
